# predicting-NACA-airfoil
The foremost step while designing an 
aerodyne vehicle is the selection of the right airfoil as per the 
flight condition. To determine the correct shape of the 
vehicle, measuring aerodynamic coefficients is the most 
essential part. According to the accuracy level, numerous 
methods exist to calculate these coefficients. The information 
about different NACA airfoil sections is in huge demand, 
although the aircraft engineers primarily use NASA's 
supercritical airfoil sections, as the NACA airfoils are still 
extensively used to design propellers, aircraft wings and they 
also find their way in many other aerodynamic applications. 
In this paper, computer-based software is used to collect data 
on these coefficients and an attempt to predict the best set of 
coefficients is tried by applying Artificial Neural Networks 
(ANNs) for different sets of Reynolds number. The code 
implements a simple feed-forward neural network for a 
regression problem using MATLAB.
